# Driver Monitoring System (DMS) – Thesis Project 🚗🧠

A real-time AI-powered application designed to monitor driver behavior and alert for states such as **drowsiness**, **distraction**, or **mobile phone usage** using a lightweight CNN model and a conversational safety assistant powered by Gemini AI. Built for intelligent fleet monitoring and road safety enhancement.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Detect unsafe driver states from live camera feed
- Provide real-time visual and auditory feedback
- Integrate a conversational AI assistant for short verbal recommendations
- Enable lightweight, portable deployment using TorchScript
- Demonstrate multimodal driver monitoring on embedded-compatible interfaces

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🎥 Live driver face detection and state classification (6 classes)
- 🧪 CNN inference using TorchScript (.pt models)
- 💬 Conversational feedback via Gemini AI
- 🔊 Audio alerts using TTS
- 📱 GUI developed with Kivy and KivyMD
- 🔄 Easily extendable to embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc.)

## 🧪 Model Variants Trained

- ✅ `mobilenetv3_large_100`
- ✅ `mobilenetv3_small_100`
- ✅ `mobilevit_xs`
- ✅ `mobilevitv2_100`
- ✅ `efficientnet_lite0`

## 🔧 Local Setup

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dms-thesis.git
cd dms-thesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create `.env` File

```bash
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

- The app captures video from a stream (`http://192.168.4.1:81/stream` by default)
- Predicts states like:
  - `focused`, `drowsy`, `sleepy`, `using phone`, `holding phone`, `yawning`
- Displays:
  - Frame with annotated face box and prediction
  - Cumulative counters for driver states
- Gemini AI triggers a short, context-aware voice reply when risky behavior is detected
